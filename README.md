Requires following directories: 
base_dir = os.path.normpath('G:/My Drive/Crick_LMS/projects/diverse_yeasts/alphafold')

y1000plus_dir = os.path.normpath('C:/Users/heineib/Documents/GitHub/y1000plus_tools/data') + os.sep

genomes_dir:  Includes genomic information from model organisms. 



# Key Scripts: 

## Ipython Scripts; 
### 20211025_alphafold_selection.ipynb
